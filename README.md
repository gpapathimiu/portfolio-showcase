# Welcome to My Portfolio Showcase!

This repository serves as a showcase for my projects, featuring two exciting applications: ArtHub and a Next.js project. Below, you'll find brief descriptions of each project along with instructions on how to navigate and run them locally.

## ArtHub

ArtHub is a social media platform built on the MERN stack, tailored for artists to share their artwork with the world. Users can upload their creations, interact through comments and likes, and enjoy a seamless experience with features like Multer integration for handling file uploads.

### Features

- **Artwork Upload:** Easily upload artwork using the provided feature.
- **Commenting:** Engage with other artists through comments.
- **Liking:** Show appreciation for artwork by liking it.
- **Multer Integration:** Seamless file upload functionality provided by Multer.

## Car Showcase

Car Showcase is a dynamic website built with TypeScript and Next.js, designed to showcase a wide variety of cars with detailed information. Leveraging two APIs, it provides users with comprehensive details about each car, including year, fuel type, make, and more. Additionally, the website fetches images to visually represent the cars, enriching the browsing experience.

### Features

- Car Data: Fetches detailed car information such as year, fuel type, make, and more from an API.
- Image Display: Utilizes another API to fetch and display images of the cars, enhancing visual appeal.
- Filtering: Enables users to filter cars based on the factors of individual car data, allowing for easy navigation and exploration of the available inventory.

Each project contains its own README.md file with instructions to get everything up and running. Feel free to dive in, experiment with the features, and let your creativity flourish. Thank you for visiting my portfolio showcase, and happy exploring! ðŸš€
